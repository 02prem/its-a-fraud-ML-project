# its-a-fraud-ML-project

## How to run the code
You can download the python files from the repo and the data
is available at the kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/its-a-fraud/data

Once you run the pre-processing file, the pre-processed data will be stored in a different csv file,
named 'pre-processed_train.csv' and 'pre-processed_test.csv'

To run the pre-processing file: python pre-processing.py

### Run the models
The model are available om the 'model' folder. Python files of different algorithms can be downloaded.
You can run any model you want to, but make sure you give the correct path for the csv files while reading and saving them for output csv.
If you are running xyz model: python <filename>.py

The XGBoost model is giving the highest score

Above all this I have also provided the jupyter notebooks for the same which will help in better understanding the EDA and pre-processing
